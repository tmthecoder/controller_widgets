# controller_widgets

Just a place for me to store some generic Controller-type widgets I made 
for reuse within my own projects

Right now, this contains the following controller-stype inherited widgets:

- RouteController
  - Controls routing in the web app path, updating the user facing URL on any calls
- ThemeController
  - A manual controller for theming to allow storing of dark/light and manual theme switching in-app 

Feel free to use them, or ask any questions!
